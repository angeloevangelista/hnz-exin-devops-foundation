# Summary of Class on Pipeline Stages

## Overview of Pipeline Stages

1. **Stage 1: Development**
   - Developer creates a contribution (e.g., commit).
   - Changes are recorded in the version control system.
   - Testing environment is created.
   - Various tests are conducted:
     - Unit Tests
     - Performance Tests
     - Integration Tests (important due to external system dependencies)

2. **Stage 2: Environment Management**
   - Multiple testing environments are created.
   - Tests include:
     - Capacity Tests
     - Resilience Tests
     - Acceptance Tests
     - Security Tests
     - Penetration Tests
   - Various deployment strategies:
     - Canary Deployment
     - Blue-Green Deployment
     - Incremental Deployment

3. **Stage 3: Production Deployment**
   - Deployment of changes to production.
   - Holdback tests to verify stability after incremental deployments.
   - Strategies to roll back if needed.

## Advantages of the Pipeline Approach

1. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Automation reduces the need for manual testing.
   - Focus on creating scripts rather than performing manual tasks.

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated tests improve code quality by providing immediate feedback.
   - Reduces the amount of manual effort required to catch issues.

3. **Faster Delivery**
   - Accelerates the deployment process compared to traditional methods.
   - Shorter feedback loops result in quicker issue resolution.

4. **Enhanced Governance**
   - Automated processes support compliance with governance and auditing requirements.
   - Improved tracking and evidence collection for audits.

## Key Acronyms and Terms

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
- **Commit**: Saving changes to the version control system
- **Unit Test**: Testing individual components of the code
- **Performance Test**: Testing how the system performs under various conditions
- **Integration Test**: Testing interactions between components or systems
- **Acceptance Test**: Testing if the system meets business requirements
- **Capacity Test**: Testing the system's ability to handle a specified load
- **Resilience Test**: Testing the system's ability to recover from failures
- **Security Test**: Testing for vulnerabilities in the system
- **Penetration Test**: Simulated attacks to identify security weaknesses
- **Canary Deployment**: Gradual deployment strategy to minimize risk
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Deployment strategy that maintains two environments (blue and green) for zero-downtime updates
- **Incremental Deployment**: Deploying changes in small, manageable increments
- **Holdback Test**: Verifying the stability of the system after incremental changes

## Considerations for Implementing a Pipeline

1. **Balancing Automation with Human Factors**
   - Ensure automation does not overshadow process and cultural aspects.
   
2. **Effective Test Automation**
   - Increased automated tests do not guarantee a properly functioning pipeline.

3. **Clear Objectives**
   - Define clear goals for the pipeline to avoid automating inefficiencies.

**Note**: The success of implementing these stages depends on careful calibration of techniques, technologies, and disciplines across different stages.
