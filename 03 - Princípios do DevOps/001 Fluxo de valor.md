# DevOps Principles and Value Stream Mapping

## Summary

In this class, we are focusing on understanding the principles of DevOps, particularly the concept of the value stream and its importance in improving organizational processes. The key topics covered include:

### 1. **Value Stream Mapping**
   - **Concept**: Transition from a fragmented delivery model to a continuous delivery model.
   - **Origins**: Adapted from Lean manufacturing techniques.
   - **Purpose**: To streamline the process of delivering value by mapping and improving each step.
   - **Techniques**: Identify and address delays, waste, and quality issues to ensure smooth and efficient delivery.

### 2. **Metrics for Measuring Value Stream**
   - **Lead Time**: Time from requirement input to solution delivery.
   - **Processing Time**: Time spent on each activity, such as coding, testing, and deployment.
   - **Percent Complete and Accurate**: Measures the quality of work and the extent of rework needed.

### 3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - **Objective**: Minimize waste and improve quality through ongoing measurement and calibration.
   - **Principles**: Use metrics to monitor performance and refine processes for better efficiency and effectiveness.
   - **Jikotei Kanketsu (JKK)**: Aim for high quality in every step of the value chain to avoid errors and rework.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **Lead Time**: Total time from requirement to delivery.
- **Processing Time**: Time required for each activity in the process.
- **Percent Complete and Accurate**: Measurement of work quality and rework.
- **Jikotei Kanketsu (JKK)**: Principle of producing high-quality work throughout the value stream.
- **Lean**: Manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement and waste reduction.

Use these concepts and metrics to optimize DevOps practices and ensure high-quality, continuous delivery in your projects.
