# DevOps Principles - Chapter 2 Summary

## Key Topics

1. **Definition of "Done" in DevOps**
   - **Correct Answer:** The requirement is done when the product is in production. This emphasizes the importance of delivering value to the customer and completing all necessary steps before the product is considered finished.

2. **Importance of Value Stream Mapping**
   - **Correct Answer:** Value stream mapping helps achieve local optimization of work practices. It allows teams to identify bottlenecks and focus efforts on areas that need improvement to enhance overall process efficiency.

3. **Origin of the Pipeline Concept**
   - **Correct Answer:** The concept of a pipeline comes from modern parallel processing techniques. It involves automating and streamlining tasks in IT, allowing for concurrent execution of activities.

4. **Role of Version Control**
   - **Correct Answer:** Version control supports balancing speed and reliability by allowing secure storage and retrieval of files. This helps manage changes and recover from mistakes without losing work.

5. **Handling Process Deficiencies**
   - **Correct Answer:** Deficiencies should be corrected as quickly as possible after detection. This approach helps maintain process quality and prevents issues from propagating through the system.
