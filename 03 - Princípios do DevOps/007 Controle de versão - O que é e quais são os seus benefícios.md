# Class Summary: Version Control Principles

## General Ideas

1. **Version Control Overview**:
   - **Purpose**: A system that stores and manages versions of electronic documents and code, allowing recovery of any previous version consistently.
   - **Scope**: Not only code but also scripts, automated tests, documentation, configurations, and tools are versioned.
   
2. **Version Control Components**:
   - **Code Source**: The primary deliverable, with different modalities.
   - **Automated Tests**: Must be compatible with the code and versioned together.
   - **Scripts and Artifacts**: Include libraries, environment configurations, and database elements.
   - **Configuration Files**: Environment-specific parameters and settings need version control.
   - **Development Tools**: Libraries and compilation parameters also need versioning.

3. **Cultural Change and Discipline**:
   - **Continuous Updates**: Version control systems need regular updates and discipline to ensure consistency.
   - **DevOps Integration**: Emphasizes the need for collaboration and incremental updates for system stability and efficiency.

4. **Impact of Version Control**:
   - **Error Recovery**: Enables autonomy in error handling and system recovery without depending on specific change authors.
   - **System Stability**: Small incremental changes make it easier to track and fix issues.
   - **Historical Tracking**: Helps in understanding what was changed, when, and why.

5. **Branching vs. Trunk-based Development**:
   - **Branch-based Development**: Authors work in isolation and merge later, which can lead to integration challenges.
   - **Trunk-based Development**: Contributions are integrated into the master branch frequently, promoting consistency and collaboration.

## Acronyms and Terms

- **Code Source**: Primary code delivered by developers.
- **Automated Tests**: Tests that validate code changes automatically.
- **Scripts**: Code used for various tasks within the system.
- **Artifacts**: Libraries, configurations, and elements needed for the solution.
- **Configuration Files**: Files that store environment-specific settings.
- **Development Tools**: Libraries and tools used for development.
- **DevOps**: A practice combining software development and IT operations.
- **Branch-based Development**: Working in isolated branches and merging later.
- **Trunk-based Development**: Direct contributions to the master branch.
- **Future Flag**: Technique for managing feature releases and code changes.
