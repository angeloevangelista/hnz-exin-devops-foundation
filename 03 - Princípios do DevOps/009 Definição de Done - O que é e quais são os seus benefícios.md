# Summary of Class: Definition of Done (Pronto)

## Overview

The concept of "Definition of Done" (Pronto) is crucial in agile and DevOps methodologies. It determines when a task or project is considered complete. This summary covers the evolution of this concept from traditional models to modern practices and highlights the key aspects to remember.

## Key Topics

1. **Traditional Definition of Done (Waterfall Model)**
   - In the Waterfall model, "Definition of Done" was when the entire solution was delivered to the user.
   - The project was considered complete only when all development, testing, and deployment were finalized.

2. **Agile Approach**
   - Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, broke the work into smaller iterations or sprints.
   - The focus shifted to making incremental progress with ongoing feedback and review.
   - The classic "Definition of Done" in Agile often meant that the feature worked on the developer's machine, but did not necessarily account for full deployment or integration.

3. **DevOps Integration**
   - DevOps extends the "Definition of Done" to include not just development but also integration, testing, and deployment.
   - The definition now covers the entire lifecycle from development through production.
   - It emphasizes the importance of functionality, performance, efficiency, and resilience.

4. **Extended Definition of Done**
   - The modern definition of done includes functional and non-functional requirements.
   - It involves optimizing performance, ensuring integration with other systems, and meeting customer expectations.
   - It requires coordination across multiple teams and integrating various disciplines.

5. **Challenges and Considerations**
   - Expanding the definition of done can be complex and may require new strategies for managing workflows, version control, configuration, and quality assurance.
   - It necessitates incorporating feedback mechanisms and monitoring to ensure high-quality delivery.
