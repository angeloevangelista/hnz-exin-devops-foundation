# Class Summary

## Key Concepts

1. **Classic vs. Modern Improvement Opportunities**
   - Classic models (e.g., Waterfall) often had long periods between interactions, making it difficult to address inefficiencies promptly.
   - Modern approaches, like those proposed by Lean, allow for immediate action and focus, minimizing dependencies and enhancing productivity.

2. **Incident and Problem Management**
   - **Incident Management**: Resolves issues immediately to restore service.
   - **Problem Management**: Analyzes the root cause of incidents at a later stage. Often optional due to cost and resource demands.
   - Modern models suggest integrating these processes to address both immediate issues and root causes simultaneously.

3. **Metrics and Visual Representation**
   - Key metrics: Lead time, process time, accuracy, and completeness.
   - Visual tools (e.g., Kanban) help in understanding and improving processes by showing where time is spent and where inefficiencies lie.

4. **Customer Value Beyond Functionalities**
   - Customers need more than just functionalities: availability, access, security, resilience, stability, and quality.
   - Efforts should be directed towards delivering comprehensive value to the customer.

5. **Integration and Prioritization**
   - Understanding the broader business impact and prioritizing activities based on their value to the customer is crucial.
   - Quality must be integrated into all aspects of the requirement list.

6. **Optimizing Flow and Identifying Bottlenecks**
   - Identify and address misalignments and bottlenecks to avoid waste and optimize the overall flow.
   - Use Theory of Constraints to focus on active constraints and iteratively improve processes.

7. **DevOps Principles**
   - Orchestrate teams, integrate competencies, and foster collaboration.
   - Aim for continuous delivery and balanced resource utilization.
   - Develop both specialist and lateral competencies (e.g., code review, automated testing).
