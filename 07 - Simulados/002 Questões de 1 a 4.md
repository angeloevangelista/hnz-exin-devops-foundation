# Class Summary

## General Ideas

1. **Interest in DevOps**
   - Organizations should consider DevOps when previous methods for increasing effectiveness have failed to yield significant results. DevOps can be a viable option if other methods are no longer effective, even though it may not be the best initial approach.
   - DevOps includes elements of Agile and Scrum but should be seen as complementary rather than a replacement. Agile practices should not be the sole trigger for adopting DevOps, but rather a consideration if other methods don't work.

2. **Backlog Requirements**
   - A DevOps team should consider both functional and non-functional requirements when working on a backlog item. This ensures a comprehensive approach that addresses both user needs and system constraints.
   - Functional requirements involve the features and functions of the product, while non-functional requirements cover aspects like performance and security.

3. **Definition of Done**
   - An item is considered "done" in DevOps when it is not only built and tested but also adds value to the customer and is in production. The focus should be on the entire value chain and not just partial work.

4. **Task Prioritization**
   - Prioritizing tasks can lead to issues if it involves significant delays in pipeline setup or development of current and future versions. The main problem is that traditional approaches require extensive decision-making upfront, which can cause substantial delays.
