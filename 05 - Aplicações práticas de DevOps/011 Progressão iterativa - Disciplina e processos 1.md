# Iterative Progression in DevOps

## Overview
This class covers the concept of **iterative progression** within DevOps, a key aspect of practical applications in DevOps. It contributes to 5% of the exam, focusing on understanding how DevOps practices can be implemented and evolved within organizations.

### Key Concepts

- **DevOps Principles**: DevOps integrates practices from agility, lean, ITIL, infrastructure resilience, and constraint theory to reduce waste, costs, and risks while enhancing predictability and agility.
- **Implementation Models**: Various models guide the implementation of DevOps, including frameworks and principles that address organizational structure, culture, regulatory elements, and competitive factors.
- **Organizational Structure**: Considerations include whether an organization is vertical, horizontal, pathological, bureaucratic, or generative. This influences how DevOps practices are adopted and integrated.
- **Team Dynamics**: Emphasis on self-directed teams over command and control, automation over manual processes, and integrating diverse competencies (T-shaped skills).
- **Management Models**: Important elements include budget management, risk management, asset management, change management, and security management.
- **Practical Practices**: 
  - **Infrastructure as Code**: Automating infrastructure setup.
  - **Dashboards**: Transparency and decision-making improvement.
  - **Open Source**: Utilizing open-source tools and practices.
  - **Automation of Audits**: Meeting regulatory requirements with automated evidence collection.
  - **Self-Service**: Enabling teams to manage their own resources and services.
  - **Rollback and Resilience Testing**: Ensuring systems can recover and perform under stress.

### Maturity Models
- **Maturity Stages**: Models range from fundamental to optimized stages, helping organizations assess their current state and future goals. Adaptation may include cloud integration, process improvements, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

### Evolution vs. Disruption
- **Evolutionary Practices**: Gradual improvements in existing processes.
- **Disruptive Practices**: Radical changes that redefine traditional methods.

### Adoption Strategies
- **Gradual Implementation**: Avoiding a "Big Bang" approach; instead, start with broad training and gradual integration.
- **Legacy Services**: Some services may remain unchanged if they are well-defined and well-supported.
- **Core Services**: Critical services may require more aggressive and innovative strategies.

## Key Terms and Acronyms

- **DevOps**: Development and Operations integration to improve collaboration and efficiency.
- **T-Shaped Skills**: Individuals with deep expertise in one area and broad knowledge in other areas.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts.
- **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous state to recover from failures.
- **Resilience Testing**: Assessing system stability and recovery under stress.
- **Self-Service**: Allowing users to manage their own resources and services.
