# Class Summary

## General Ideas

1. **Pilot Projects for DevOps Implementation**
   - Start with small pilot projects using a limited team.
   - Focus on quick wins to demonstrate impact.
   - Engage early adopters (innovators and visionaries) to lead the change.
   - Gradually involve more pragmatic, conservative, and skeptical individuals.
   - Avoid involving skeptics initially to prevent sabotage.

2. **Adoption Curve**
   - Innovators and visionaries lead initial changes.
   - Pragmatics require evidence of success before adopting.
   - Conservatives and skeptics are brought in later once initial successes are proven.

3. **Service Dependencies and Constraints**
   - Be aware of interdependencies between services.
   - Address the weakest link to prevent bottlenecks.
   - Use the Theory of Constraints to optimize the weakest areas first.

4. **Choosing Market Agents**
   - Select appropriate market agents to support business goals.
   - Be prepared to replace agents if they don't meet requirements.

5. **Development Practices**
   - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**
     - Develop tests before writing code.
     - Results in more robust and error-resistant code.
   - **Pair Programming**
     - Improves code quality through real-time collaboration.
     - Helps with learning and consistency in coding standards.
   - **Code Reviews**
     - Conducted through pull requests or passive review.
     - Enhances code quality and enforces standards.

6. **Automated Testing**
   - Not always necessary to cover 100% of code.
   - Focus on critical and frequently executed code sections.

7. **Continuous Integration**
   - Integrate code changes frequently to ensure consistency and quality.
