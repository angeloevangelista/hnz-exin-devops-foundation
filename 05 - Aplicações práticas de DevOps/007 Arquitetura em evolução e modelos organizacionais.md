# Class Summary: Architecture, Evolution, and Organizational Models

## Topics Covered

### 1. Architecture and Models
- **Different Architectures**: Understanding various types of software architectures and models, including their trends and applicability.
- **Impact of Changes**: Small changes can have negative side effects due to lack of control, automated testing, or domain knowledge.
- **Continuous Integration**: Coordination of code changes among developers, especially in dynamic and collaborative environments.

### 2. Challenges with Monolithic Architecture
- **Coordination Issues**: Difficulty in managing simultaneous changes by multiple developers.
- **Dependency on Key Personnel**: High reliance on specific individuals, leading to potential risks if they are overloaded or leave.
- **Documentation Obsolescence**: Code evolution outpaces documentation updates, making it quickly outdated.

### 3. Integration of Development and Operations
- **Historical Separation**: Development and operations teams often work separately, causing misalignment.
- **Impact on Problem Resolution**: Operations teams may lack the depth of knowledge needed to handle complex issues, escalating them to development teams.

### 4. Evolving Architecture
- **Obsolescence**: Architectures may become outdated as they fail to meet new requirements.
- **Management Complexity**: Managing evolving architectures and code becomes more challenging over time.

### 5. Architectural Models and Solutions
- **Modular/Componentized Architectures**: Break down systems into smaller, manageable components.
- **Microservices**: Smaller, independently deployable services that enhance scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architectures**: Focus on triggers and events to manage system interactions.
- **Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA)**: Services that provide specific functionalities, often used in various contexts.
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining elements from different architectural models to suit specific needs.

### 6. Choosing the Right Architecture
- **Fit for Purpose**: Select architectures based on the specific needs of the system, whether for internal use or large-scale user bases.
- **Complexity Management**: Smaller components can increase management complexity but may improve stability.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: A development practice that requires frequent integration of code changes.
- **SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)**: An architectural pattern in which software components provide services to other components over a network.
- **Microservices**: An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A design pattern where events trigger actions within the system.
- **Modular Architecture**: Breaking down a system into smaller, interchangeable modules or components.
