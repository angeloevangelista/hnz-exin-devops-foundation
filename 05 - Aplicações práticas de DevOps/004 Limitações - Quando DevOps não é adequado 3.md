# Class Summary

## Overview

This class focuses on the challenges and limitations organizations face when using outsourced software development teams and the difficulties in adapting traditional structures to more modern, flexible approaches such as DevOps. It covers issues related to internal integration, organizational resistance to change, and the limitations of monolithic architectures.

### Key Topics

1. **Outsourced Development Teams**
   - **Challenges**: Lack of loyalty, high turnover, integration difficulties, and limited accountability.
   - **Impact**: Reduced strategic value due to fragmented teams and potential exposure of organizational needs to competitors.

2. **Organizational Resistance to Change**
   - **Challenges**: Bureaucratic inertia, rigid hierarchies, and slow decision-making processes.
   - **Impact**: Difficulty in implementing agile practices and adapting to modern development methodologies.

3. **Monolithic Architecture**
   - **Challenges**: Difficulties in integrating small teams and adapting to changes due to tightly coupled components.
   - **Impact**: Increased complexity and risk when modifying or scaling systems, necessitating techniques like componentization and incremental changes.

## Terms and Acronyms

- **DevOps**: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration and productivity.
- **Pipeline**: A set of automated processes that integrate code changes, build, test, and deploy applications.
- **Componentization**: Breaking down a software system into smaller, manageable components to improve flexibility and maintainability.
- **Strangulation**: A technique for gradually replacing old systems with new ones by incrementally adding new features and migrating existing functionality.
- **Branch by Abstraction**: A method of managing changes in a codebase where new functionality is introduced through abstraction layers, allowing for incremental updates.

## Summary

Organizations must carefully manage the integration of outsourced teams, address bureaucratic resistance to change, and consider modern architectural approaches to remain agile and effective in today's fast-paced development environment. Adopting practices that support flexibility, accountability, and incremental improvements can help overcome these challenges.
