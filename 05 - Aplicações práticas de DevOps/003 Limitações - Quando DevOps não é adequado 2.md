# Class Summary

## General Ideas

1. **Commercial of the Self (COTS)**:
   - Refers to third-party software packages offered by vendors.
   - Offers a mature solution allowing for quick deployment and use.

2. **Challenges with COTS**:
   - **Fit for Purpose**: The software must closely match business needs to avoid significant customization.
   - **Vendor Dependency**: Reliance on the vendor for updates, bug fixes, and customization can be risky.
   - **Technical Debt**: Some solutions may have large technical debts or be monolithic, making them less adaptable.
   - **Security and Resilience**: Assess if the software is secure, resilient, and capable of self-recovery.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - **Adaptability**: How easily can the software be adapted to changing needs?
   - **Security**: Is the software secure against potential threats?
   - **Resilience**: Does the software recover from failures effectively?
   - **Visibility**: Can you monitor and manage the software effectively?

4. **Competitive Edge**:
   - Using a standard COTS package might not provide a competitive advantage if competitors use the same solution.
   - Customization and differentiators may be needed to stand out in the market.

5. **Vendor Limitations**:
   - **Response Time**: Vendor delays in addressing issues or implementing changes.
   - **Version Control**: Managing software updates and ensuring they do not disrupt current operations.

6. **Applicability**:
   - COTS solutions might be suitable for non-core business activities.
   - Core activities may require more control and customization.
