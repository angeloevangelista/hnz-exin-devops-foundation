# Class Summary: DevOps Challenges and Strategies

## Summary of Topics

1. **Challenges with DevOps in Organizations with Outsourced Development**
   - Companies that do not develop their own software but instead outsource development face significant challenges in implementing DevOps. This is due to difficulties in team engagement and integration.

2. **Issues with External Development Teams**
   - Organizations using their own software but relying on external developers struggle with team engagement and the alignment of external teams with organizational goals. This is compared to the difference between "mercenary" and "missionary" teams, with mission-driven teams being more engaged and proactive.

3. **Resistance to Organizational Restructuring**
   - Companies resistant to large-scale restructuring or adaptation may face challenges in implementing DevOps, especially in unstable environments like those affected by frequent mergers, acquisitions, or financial crises.

4. **Challenges with Monolithic Architecture**
   - Companies with tightly-coupled monolithic architectures face difficulties in adopting DevOps practices. This is contrasted with "Unicorn" companies (e.g., Facebook, Google, Amazon) that have successfully navigated these challenges by recognizing the importance of technology and breaking down monolithic structures.
