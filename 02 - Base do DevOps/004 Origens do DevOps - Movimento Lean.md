# Summary of Key Topics

## Overview
This class covers key concepts related to Lean methodology (LIM) and how it identifies and addresses waste in processes, particularly in IT and DevOps environments. The focus is on understanding different types of waste, their impact on productivity, and strategies to minimize them.

## Key Topics

### 1. Partially Completed Work
- **Problem**: Activities that are started but not completed lead to waste, as they can become outdated or lose priority.
- **Impact**: Context switching wastes time and can lead to obsolescence of tasks.

### 2. Extra Processes
- **Problem**: Excessive bureaucracy and unnecessary steps in processes add no value.
- **Impact**: Causes delays and inefficiencies. It's crucial to question if each step adds value for the client.

### 3. Extra Resources (Perfumarias)
- **Problem**: Investing time in superficial features or tasks that do not add value.
- **Impact**: Wastes time and resources, especially in intellectual work environments.

### 4. Context Switching
- **Problem**: Moving between tasks disrupts focus and leads to repetitive, unproductive work.
- **Impact**: Loss of prioritization and diminished quality of work.

### 5. Waiting
- **Problem**: Delays caused by waiting for other tasks to complete or for resources to become available.
- **Impact**: Extends project timelines and causes unmet expectations.

### 6. Motion Waste
- **Problem**: Unnecessary movement of people or resources.
- **Impact**: Loss of time and reduced efficiency.

### 7. Defects
- **Problem**: Errors in work that are only detected late in the process.
- **Impact**: Leads to rework and potential cascading failures in the production line.

### 8. Manual Work
- **Problem**: Reliance on manual processes can lead to human errors.
- **Impact**: Automation should be utilized to reduce errors and improve efficiency.

### 9. Heroism
- **Problem**: Over-reliance on a few "heroes" in the team who are seen as indispensable.
- **Impact**: Creates dependency and can lead to lower overall quality and team engagement.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **LIM (Lean Information Management)**: A methodology that focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value in processes.
- **DevOps**: A set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.
- **Andon**: A system used in manufacturing that alerts operators to stop the production line to fix issues immediately, ensuring quality is maintained.
- **Fordism**: A system of mass production pioneered by Ford Motor Company, emphasizing specialization and efficiency but potentially at the cost of worker engagement and product quality.
