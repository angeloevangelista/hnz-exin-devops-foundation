# Summary of the Class

## General Ideas

### Continuous Delivery and DevOps Integration
- **Transition from Waterfall to Agile:** The course discusses the evolution from traditional waterfall models to more agile practices, focusing on how continuous delivery (CD) changes the process by breaking down activities into smaller, manageable pieces rather than large, sequential blocks.
- **Manual to Automated Processes:** Historically, many processes like building releases and testing were manual. The shift towards automation in DevOps aims to minimize errors and improve efficiency by automating tasks such as release management, testing, and deployment.
- **Governance and Risk Management:** Continuous delivery also requires engagement with organizational governance to ensure that automated processes are controlled, risks are managed, and the quality of the solution is maintained throughout deployment.
  
### Evolving from Traditional to Modern Practices
- **Adapting Traditional Processes:** The class explains the need to adapt traditional processes, such as change management (formerly managed through CABs), to the continuous and automated nature of CD and DevOps.
- **Technical Debt and Agility:** The burden of technical debt in agile projects is discussed, particularly how it leads to inefficiencies and how service management attempts to control it through incident resolution and root cause analysis.
- **Service Management:** Traditional service management practices are contrasted with the agile approach, highlighting the challenges in maintaining availability and evolving architecture within a manual, waterfall framework.

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Automation as a Lever:** Automation is essential for making continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) effective. The goal is to maintain a consistent flow of updates and minimize disruption in production environments.
- **Flow of Work:** Emphasizes reducing waste and increasing efficiency by breaking down work into smaller, more manageable deliveries, which aligns with lean principles.
- **Techniques for Deployment:** Different deployment strategies such as Blue-Green, Canary, and Feature Flags are introduced as methods to manage releases in production without significant risks.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **CD (Continuous Delivery):** The practice of continuously delivering software to production in small, manageable increments.
- **DevOps:** A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle.
- **CAB (Change Advisory Board):** A group responsible for evaluating and approving changes in a traditional IT setting.
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** A practice where developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository, which is then automatically tested.
- **Technical Debt:** The cost of rework required when choosing a quicker, less optimal solution that may cause issues in the long run.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** A release management strategy where two environments (blue and green) are used to reduce downtime and risk.
- **Canary Deployment:** A strategy where a new version is slowly rolled out to a small subset of users before full deployment.
- **Feature Flags:** Techniques used to enable or disable features in a production environment without deploying new code.
