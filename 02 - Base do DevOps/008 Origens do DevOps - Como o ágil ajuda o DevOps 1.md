# Class Summary

## General Concepts

This class covers the evolution of organizational maturity within DevOps practices, focusing on the progression from Continuous Integration (CI) to Continuous Delivery (CD), and ultimately to Continuous Deployment (CD). Key topics include:

1. **Three Ways in DevOps**:
   - **First Way**: Focuses on speeding up the flow of work from left (development) to right (operations).
   - **Second Way**: Involves feedback loops to continuously refine and improve processes.
   - **Third Way**: Centers on creating a culture of learning and continual experimentation.

2. **Small Development Teams**:
   - The importance of smaller teams is emphasized to increase individual participation, reduce overhead, and improve team morale.
   - Challenges include dependency on architecture and the need for clear division of responsibilities among teams.

3. **Faster Delivery Cycles**:
   - Transitioning from traditional, lengthy development cycles to faster, iterative cycles (from years to hours or days).
   - This shift allows for more frequent and visible results, which boosts team morale and better aligns with business needs.

4. **Integration of DevOps Practices**:
   - Combining Lean, Agile, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices to reduce technical debt and increase operational efficiency.
   - The class discusses how DevOps promotes a closer integration of IT and business, enabling rapid feedback and continuous improvement.

5. **Managing Technical Debt**:
   - Technical debt arises when shortcuts are taken to meet deadlines, but it must be managed and minimized.
   - The importance of continuous improvement (Kaizen) to maintain a system's "fitness" and prevent long-term inefficiencies.

## Key Terms and Acronyms

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: A practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.
  
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment)**:
  - **Continuous Delivery**: Ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state, but deployments are manual.
  - **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploys all code changes that pass the automated tests into production.

- **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)**: The process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

- **Kaizen**: A Japanese term meaning "change for the better" or continuous improvement. In DevOps, it refers to the ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes.

- **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or quick solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

- **Feedback Loop**: In DevOps, this refers to the continuous cycle of getting feedback from the system to improve and refine the processes and systems.
