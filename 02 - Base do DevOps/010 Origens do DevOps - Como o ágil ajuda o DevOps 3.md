# Class Summary

## General Ideas

- **Team Productivity**: When a team becomes more productive and feels more active, their creativity, engagement, and interest improve. This results in a more stable solution, better market positioning, and higher customer satisfaction.
  
- **Client and Team Loyalty**: A highly engaged team fosters greater loyalty from both customers and team members compared to previous conditions.

- **Efficient Workflows**: Transitioning from long waits, rework, and urgent tasks to more efficient, concrete work is beneficial. Stable market positioning and strong returns are achievable with this approach.

- **Defining Deadlines**: Deadlines are often influenced by external factors such as marketing strategies or management pressures rather than the actual work conditions. This can lead to decreased quality and longer timelines.

- **Models of Work Delivery**:
  - **Push Model**: Large batches of work are produced and delivered at once, leading to potential delays and inefficiencies.
  - **Pull Model**: Work is done on a just-in-time basis, addressing each request as it comes, which improves efficiency.
  - **Incremental Delivery**: Delivering parts of the work progressively, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments, ultimately results in a more stable and predictable delivery process.

- **Continuous Deployment**: Implementing solutions in small increments allows for continuous integration and avoids large-scale disruptions. This approach reduces stress and enhances stability.

## Key Acronyms and Terms

- **Push Model**: A workflow where large amounts of work are pushed to production in bulk, often leading to inefficiencies and delays.
  
- **Pull Model**: A workflow where work is pulled into production as needed, improving efficiency by handling tasks as they arise.

- **Incremental Delivery**: The process of delivering work in small, manageable pieces to allow for ongoing feedback and adjustments.

- **Continuous Deployment**: The practice of frequently releasing small updates to production, ensuring stability and reducing stress.

- **Integration Continuous**: Often related to continuous deployment, this refers to the ongoing integration of new code into the existing system to maintain stability and functionality.
