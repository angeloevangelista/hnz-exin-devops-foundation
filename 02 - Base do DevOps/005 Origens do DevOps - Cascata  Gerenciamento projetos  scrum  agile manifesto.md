## Class Summary: Key Concepts and Ideas

### 1. **Visibility of Work in Intellectual Tasks**
   - **Challenge**: In intellectual work, unlike manufacturing, the progress isn't visible, leading to potential delays and mismanagement.
   - **Solution**: Use tools like **Kanban boards** to visualize tasks, manage workloads, and track progress across various stages.

### 2. **Kanban Board**
   - **Functionality**: Represents tasks as cards that move through columns representing different stages of work.
   - **Benefits**: 
     - Helps identify bottlenecks.
     - Manages the flow of work.
     - Provides visibility on who is overloaded or idle.

### 3. **Operation Models in IT Service Management (OITCM)**
   - **Lifecycle**: Encompasses strategic planning, service design, and service transition.
   - **Integration**: Project management should integrate with service lifecycle, ensuring a smooth transition from development to operation.

### 4. **DevOps Integration**
   - **Definition**: Combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) into a unified workflow.
   - **Goal**: Enhance collaboration and continuous integration of new features into the service lifecycle.

### 5. **Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies**
   - **Waterfall**:
     - **Scope**: Fixed scope, cost, and schedule.
     - **Use Case**: Suitable when project requirements are well-defined and stable.
   - **Agile**:
     - **Scope**: Variable scope with fixed team size and iterations.
     - **Use Case**: Suitable when project requirements are likely to evolve over time.
     - **Frameworks**: Scrum is a key framework used within Agile.

### 6. **Scrum Framework**
   - **Elements**:
     - **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features or tasks.
     - **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations (2-5 weeks).
     - **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
   - **Meetings**:
     - **Sprint Planning**: Defines what to achieve in the sprint.
     - **Daily Standups**: Short daily check-ins.
     - **Sprint Review**: Review completed work.
     - **Retrospective**: Reflect on the process and improve.

### 7. **Agile Manifesto and Principles**
   - **Core Values**:
     - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
     - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
     - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
     - Responding to change over following a plan.
   - **Principles**: Emphasizes customer satisfaction, welcoming changes, delivering frequently, sustainable development, simplicity, and continuous improvement.

### 8. **Continuous Delivery and Value Flow**
   - **Goal**: Seamlessly transition work from development to production, emphasizing continuous delivery and minimizing waste.
