# Summary of DevOps Class

## General Ideas

### Origins of DevOps
- **DevOps Evolution**: DevOps originated around 2009 from emerging practices that eventually became standardized as best practices in organizations.
- **Best Practices and Standards**: Best practices, once proven successful, evolve into market standards like ISO 27000 and 20000, especially in IT.
- **DevOps as a Service**: Thereâ€™s a growing trend of automating DevOps, where code is deployed and operationalized automatically, showing the maturity and evolution of DevOps practices.

### Influential Movements
1. **Lean Movement**:
   - Originated from the Toyota Production System, focusing on waste reduction, quality standards, and operational efficiency.
   - It influenced DevOps by promoting systematic practices and discipline.

2. **Agility Movement**:
   - Emerged in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, promoting adaptive, iterative, and incremental approaches in software development.
   - Agile methodologies support more efficient and effective delivery, directly influencing DevOps practices.

3. **Agile Infrastructure**:
   - Concept of treating infrastructure as code, promoting automation and consistency in deployment environments.
   - Pioneered by Patrick Debois, the founder of DevOps, this approach reduces manual intervention and increases scalability and reproducibility.

4. **Continuous Delivery**:
   - Involves the automation of the entire pipeline: continuous integration, delivery, deployment, testing, and monitoring.
   - Often confused with DevOps itself, continuous delivery is a core aspect but not the entirety of DevOps.

5. **Lean Startup**:
   - Introduces the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and iterative learning cycles (Build-Measure-Learn), which complement DevOps by promoting rapid experimentation and learning.

6. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Stability, scalability, security, and other non-functional requirements are critical for successful DevOps implementation.
   - Techniques like Netflix's Chaos Engineering test and enhance system resilience in production.

7. **Cultural and Organizational Changes**:
   - DevOps requires a cultural shift towards collaboration, blame reduction, and continuous learning within organizations.
   - The adoption of DevOps is often hindered by rigid, established organizational cultures, making cultural transformation crucial for success.

### Specific Movements and Techniques
- **Theory of Constraints**: A method to identify and manage bottlenecks in processes, applicable to DevOps for improving overall efficiency.
- **Resilience Engineering**: Focuses on building systems that can adapt and continue functioning in the face of unexpected issues.
- **Human Factors and Organizational Learning**: Emphasizes the importance of soft skills, collaboration, and learning from failures to foster a positive and creative working environment.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **DevOps**: Development and Operations, a set of practices aimed at automating and integrating the processes of software development and IT operations.
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product, a product with just enough features to gather feedback and validate learning.
- **ISO**: International Organization for Standardization, which provides standards like ISO 27000 for information security management.
- **Continuous Delivery**: The practice of automating the software release process to ensure faster and more reliable deployments.
- **Agile**: A methodology that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts rather than manual processes.
