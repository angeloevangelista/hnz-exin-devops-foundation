# Class Summary

## General Ideas

1. **Automation Importance**
   - Automation is crucial for stabilizing solutions but needs critical reflection. Initial automation may be basic and evolve over time.
   - The automation process itself should become increasingly seamless and less dependent on manual activities.

2. **Visibility and Telemetry**
   - Increasing visibility is essential through telemetry, monitoring, and instrumentation.
   - Monitoring includes understanding test durations, test pass/fail rates, and the nature of failures (tolerable or critical).

3. **Error Handling and Resilience**
   - Address and eliminate root causes of failures to avoid recurring issues.
   - Emphasis on automated recovery and resilience to minimize disruption and maintain operational stability.

4. **Evolution of IT Management**
   - Shift from traditional IT management (which involved manual, multi-level handling of issues) to more automated and efficient processes.
   - Avoid reliance on temporary fixes and focus on long-term solutions to reduce manual intervention.

5. **Team Productivity and Focus**
   - Improving system stability and automation allows teams to focus on productive tasks rather than constantly dealing with crises.
