# Summary of Class

## General Ideas

### 1. Waterfall Model Overview
- **Waterfall Model Stages:** Definition, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, integration, acceptance testing, and deployment.
- **Challenges:** 
  - **Rigidity:** Difficult to adapt to changes after initial stages.
  - **Risk Management:** Assumes that requirements will remain stable.
  - **Sequential Dependencies:** Each stage depends on the completion of the previous one, leading to potential delays and increased effort in rework.

### 2. Incremental Development
- **Modular Approach:** Development focuses on breaking down the system into modules (e.g., registration, processing, calculation).
- **Testing Dependencies:** Modules cannot be fully tested until their dependencies (previous stages) are complete.
- **Limitations:** Still retains some of the Waterfall model's drawbacks, especially in terms of flexibility and customer value orientation.

### 3. Agile Methodology
- **Agile Introduction:** Developed to address the limitations of the Waterfall model, promoting regular deliveries and adaptability to changes.
- **Continuous Integration:** Early and frequent integration of code, reducing the effort needed to merge and validate code later in the project.
- **Agility Challenges:** Agility itself introduced complexities that were later addressed by DevOps practices.

### 4. DevOps and Continuous Delivery
- **Evolution:** Agility led to the foundation of DevOps to better handle the integration and deployment challenges.
- **Continuous Delivery:** The ability to validate and approve solutions quickly, making them ready for deployment at any time.
- **Focus on Non-Functional Requirements:** Ensuring the product is reliable, available, secure, and meets user needs in real-world conditions.

## Key Terms & Acronyms

- **Waterfall Model:** A traditional software development methodology with sequential stages.
- **Incremental Development:** A method that builds a system in smaller parts or increments.
- **Agile Methodology:** A flexible approach to software development focused on iterative progress and adaptability.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** The practice of frequently merging all developer working copies to a shared mainline.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** An approach where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
- **DevOps:** A set of practices combining software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle.
