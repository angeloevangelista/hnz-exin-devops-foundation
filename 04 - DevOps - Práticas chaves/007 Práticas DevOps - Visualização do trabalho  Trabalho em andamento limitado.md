# Class Summary

## Key Topics

1. **Visualization in DevOps**
   - Importance of a common visualization for team tasks and flow.
   - Tracking tasks: current status, bottlenecks, and capacity.
   - Visual tools like Kanban help in analyzing task stages and managing workflow.

2. **Kanban vs. Scrum**
   - Kanban focuses on task completion and limiting work in progress.
   - In Scrum, daily stand-ups involve individual updates, whereas Kanban focuses on the status of tasks/cards.

3. **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits**
   - Limiting WIP helps prioritize tasks and reduces cycle time.
   - Managing flow helps reduce waste and improves quality.

4. **Pull vs. Push Systems**
   - **Pull System:** Tasks are pulled by demand; work continues until completion.
   - **Push System:** Tasks are pushed with no regard for demand; may lead to large batches and inefficiencies.

5. **Lead Time and Estimation**
   - Lead time is the actual time taken from start to finish of a task.
   - Using concrete lead time data improves estimation accuracy and reduces reliance on predictions.

6. **Visibility and Optimization**
   - Improved visibility of constraints and interruptions.
   - Optimizing resource usage and reducing reprogramming of work.
