# Class Summary: DevOps and Change Management

## General Ideas

- **Change Management in DevOps**: Change can be both evolutionary and disruptive. Evolutionary changes involve incremental improvements, while disruptive changes might overhaul existing processes or technologies. The approach includes continuous improvement techniques like Kaizen, which focus on incremental and constructive enhancements in daily work.

- **Release and Deployment**:
  - **Release**: A release is a new version of software that introduces new functionalities and is subject to formal approval processes. It represents a significant milestone that will eventually replace the current production version.
  - **Deploy**: Deployment refers to the act of installing the release into the production environment. In modern DevOps practices, the focus may shift from building releases to managing deployments, which can involve frequent, small increments that collectively lead to significant changes.

- **Incremental Delivery**: Instead of delivering a complete release all at once, DevOps emphasizes continuous delivery of small increments. This approach allows for gradual improvements, akin to delivering small pieces of a pizza over time until the whole pizza is complete.

- **Quality vs. Schedule**: Traditional practices often prioritize meeting deadlines, sometimes at the expense of quality. In DevOps, quality is prioritized, and releases are only deployed once they meet quality standards. This approach reduces the risk of post-release issues and the need for extensive rework.

- **Decision-Making**: In traditional IT, decisions are often made from a technical perspective. In DevOps, decisions are business-driven, with a focus on aligning deployments with business priorities. The goal is to ensure that IT decisions support business needs effectively, rather than being driven solely by technical constraints.

## Specific Acronyms or Terms to Remember

- **Kaizen**: A Japanese term meaning "continuous improvement," focusing on incremental changes to enhance processes and workflows.

- **Release**: A version of software with new functionalities, going through formal approval before deployment.

- **Deploy**: The process of installing a release into the production environment.

- **Feature Flag**: A technique used to enable or disable specific features in a software application without deploying new code (not discussed in detail but relevant).

- **DevOps**: A set of practices aimed at integrating development and operations to improve collaboration, efficiency, and continuous delivery of value.

- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, practices that automate the process of integrating and deploying code changes.

- **Incremental Delivery**: The practice of delivering software in small, manageable pieces rather than in large, infrequent releases.
