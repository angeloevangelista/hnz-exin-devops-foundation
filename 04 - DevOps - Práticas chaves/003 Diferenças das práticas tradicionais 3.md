# Class Summary

## General Ideas

- **Routine Deployments**: Deployments become a regular routine, allowing incremental and secure transitions of solutions. Changes are applied in small increments to minimize impact and allow quick recovery if issues arise.
- **Controlled Changes**: Changes are documented, with backups and version control in place. Releases are scheduled and planned to ensure minimal disruption and easy rollback if needed.
- **DevOps Transition**: The traditional process of detailed documentation and manual backups is streamlined. With DevOps, releases are automated, frequent, and tested centrally, leading to more stable and efficient deployments.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment**: Releases can occur multiple times a day with minimal risk, as automated processes handle frequent, small updates.
- **Business Decisions**: Releases are driven by business needs rather than technical constraints. Teams focus on meeting business requirements, reducing unnecessary efforts, and improving quality.
- **Testing and Validation**: A/B testing and simultaneous version support are used to validate new solutions against existing ones. This enables rapid decision-making based on performance and user impact.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember

- **DevOps**: Development and Operations integration for continuous integration and delivery.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing two versions of a solution to determine which performs better.
- **Version Control**: Managing changes to code and configurations to track and revert changes as needed.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploying code changes to production as soon as they pass testing.
