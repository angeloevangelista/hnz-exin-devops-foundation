# Class Summary: Improving Flow and Quality in Development

## Key Concepts

- **Flow Calibration**: Adjusting workflows to handle smaller batch sizes for more efficient testing and validation.
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Starting with a basic version of a product to test and refine through iterative improvements.
- **Small Batch Sizes**: Breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces to enhance testing, quality, and delivery.
- **Lead Time Reduction**: Minimizing the time from task initiation to completion by maintaining a steady workflow.
- **Error Reduction**: Focusing on smaller increments to better identify and fix errors.
- **Quality and Resource Utilization**: Improving product quality by incorporating non-functional requirements like accessibility, reliability, and scalability.
- **Team Interaction**: Encouraging collaboration between development and operations teams to enhance both functional and non-functional aspects of the solution.
- **Technical Debt Management**: Allocating time within the backlog for activities aimed at reducing technical debt and improving overall code quality.
- **Kaizen Practices**: Implementing small, continuous improvements to optimize processes and outcomes.
- **Experimentation and Learning**: Utilizing collective experimentation and practices like pair programming and code reviews to refine and stabilize the code.

## Terms and Acronyms to Remember

- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product
- **Lead Time**: The total time from the beginning to the end of a process.
- **SLA**: Service Level Agreement
- **Kaizen**: Continuous improvement practices
- **Technical Debt**: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.
- **DevOps**: Development and Operations collaboration to enhance the software development lifecycle.
- **Backlog**: A prioritized list of work for the development team.
- **Pair Programming**: A practice where two programmers work together at one workstation.
- **Code Review**: The process of examining source code to find mistakes and improve quality.
