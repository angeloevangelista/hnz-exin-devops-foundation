# Class Summary: DevOps Practices

## General Ideas

1. **GS Ambler Model**: This model is somewhat complex but effective for exploring and improving processes.
   
2. **Visualization Tools**: Use tools that allow for rapid improvement based on current monitoring and extensive exploration of solution elements.

3. **Flow Analysis**: Analyze the flow in terms of steps, time, delays, and waits. Make small changes based on value stream mapping and identify bottlenecks.

4. **Bottleneck Management**: Eliminate bottlenecks to improve the flow, which may lead to new bottlenecks in different areas. Continuously work on the most significant bottleneck.

5. **Iterative Improvement**: The process is repetitive, integrative, and interactive, focusing on improvement based on concrete data from end-to-end value stream measurements.

## Acronyms and Terms to Remember
